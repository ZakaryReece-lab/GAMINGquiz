### HTML Explanation

The HTML file structures the web page content and defines the layout and sections.

#### Head Section

The doctype declaration at the top defines the document as an HTML5 document. The `<html>` element is the root of the HTML document, with a `lang` attribute specifying the language as English. Inside the `<head>` element, several meta tags provide information about the document. These include the character encoding set to UTF-8, ensuring proper text display, and the viewport settings, which make the webpage responsive across different devices. The meta description provides a summary of the webpage's content for search engines, while the meta keywords help with search engine optimization. The author meta tag identifies the creator of the webpage.

A favicon link specifies a small icon to be displayed in the browser tab. The link to the external CSS file includes styles for the webpage. Additionally, a link to Font Awesome allows the use of various icons throughout the page.

#### Body Section

The body contains all the visible content on the webpage. The header section contains the main title of the quiz, styled to be prominent and centered. The navigation bar includes links to different sections of the page: Home, Quiz, Feedback, and Contact. It also contains a navigation icon for mobile users to toggle the menu. The home section welcomes users to the quiz and provides instructions on starting the quiz. The quiz section includes an input for entering a username, a container where quiz questions are dynamically injected via JavaScript, and buttons to navigate through the quiz, reset it, or restart it. The feedback section provides a form for users to submit feedback, including a text area for entering feedback and a submit button. The contact section includes a form for users to contact the developers, with inputs for the user's name, email, and message, along with a submit button. The footer contains social media links, allowing users to visit the project's social media pages.

### CSS Explanation

The CSS file styles the HTML elements, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing design.

#### Importing Fonts

Google Fonts are imported to use custom fonts for styling the text. This enhances the visual appeal and readability of the webpage by using fonts that are specifically designed for digital screens and offer a variety of styles.

#### Basic Reset

A basic CSS reset is applied to remove default padding and margin from all elements, and to set the box-sizing property to border-box. This ensures that padding and borders are included in the element's total width and height, making layout calculations more predictable and consistent across different browsers.

#### Header Styles

The header section is styled to be the full width of the page and center-align the text. A dark background color is set to create contrast with the white text, making the title stand out. Padding and margin are added to ensure there is space around the header, and the title inside the header is made bold with a responsive font size and uppercase text transformation for emphasis.

#### Body Styles

The body element is styled with a custom font family, ensuring all text on the page uses the same font for a cohesive look. A background image is applied to the entire page, set to cover the entire background without repeating, ensuring a visually appealing backdrop. The color of the text is set to white for readability against the dark background. Flexbox is used for layout, centering content horizontally and vertically and ensuring responsiveness by adjusting the layout based on the screen size. Padding is added to create a border effect, giving the content some breathing room.

#### Navigation Bar Styles

The navigation bar is styled with a dark background and white text to match the header. Flexbox is used to layout the navigation links, centering them horizontally and ensuring they are evenly spaced. A mobile-friendly navigation icon is initially hidden but displayed on smaller screens to toggle the menu. Navigation links are styled with smooth color transitions on hover, providing visual feedback to users when they interact with the links.

#### Section Styles

Each section (home, quiz, feedback, contact) is styled with a semi-transparent black background to create contrast with the text and ensure readability. Padding is added to create space around the content, and rounded corners are used for a smooth, modern look. Background images are applied to each section, set to cover the entire section without repeating, ensuring a visually appealing background. Text alignment is set to the left for readability.

#### Form Styles

Forms in the feedback and contact sections are styled to align items flexibly, making them easy to use on different screen sizes. Padding and borders are added to inputs, text areas, and buttons to make them stand out and be easy to interact with. Buttons are styled to change color on hover, providing visual feedback and enhancing the user experience. Consistent spacing and width are maintained for a clean, organized look.

#### Responsive Design

Media queries are used to adjust styles for different screen sizes, ensuring the layout remains user-friendly on all devices. For mobile devices, the navigation icon is displayed, and the navigation links are hidden by default, stacking vertically when displayed. Padding and margins are adjusted for smaller screens, ensuring the layout remains compact and easy to navigate. For larger screens, padding, margins, and font sizes are increased to make use of the additional space and enhance readability.

### JavaScript Explanation

The JavaScript file adds interactivity to the quiz, dynamically updating content and handling user input.

#### Quiz Data

The quiz data is stored in an array of objects, where each object represents a quiz question. Each object contains a question string, an array of options, and the correct answer. This structure allows easy access and manipulation of the quiz data.

#### Variables

Several variables are used to manage the state of the quiz:

- `currentQuestionIndex` keeps track of the current question being displayed.
- `userAnswers` is an array that stores the answers provided by the user.
- `username` stores the username entered by the user.

#### Functions

##### `initializeQuiz`

This function initializes the quiz by displaying the first question and hiding the reset and restart buttons initially. It sets up the initial state of the quiz.

##### `displayQuestion`

This function takes an index as an argument and displays the corresponding question and its options. It selects the question container element from the HTML and injects the question and options into it. Each option is displayed as a radio button, allowing the user to select one answer.

##### `nextQuestion`

This function handles the transition to the next question. It first validates the username input to ensure it is not empty. If the username is valid, it retrieves the selected option for the current question and stores it in the `userAnswers` array. It then increments the `currentQuestionIndex` to move to the next question. If the current question is the last one, it calls the `showResults` function to display the results.

##### `showResults`

This function calculates the user's score by comparing their answers with the correct answers. It generates an HTML string displaying the user's score and which questions were answered correctly or incorrectly. The results are then displayed in the quiz section, and the reset and restart buttons are shown.

##### `resetQuiz`

This function resets all quiz data, including the `currentQuestionIndex` and `userAnswers` array. It also clears the username input and reinitializes the quiz.

##### `restartQuiz`

Similar to `resetQuiz`, this function resets the quiz data but does not clear the username. It reinitializes the quiz from the first question.

##### `handleFeedbackSubmission`

This function handles the submission of the feedback form. It prevents the default form submission behavior, retrieves the feedback text, and validates its length. If the feedback is sufficiently detailed, it displays a thank you message.

##### `handleContactFormSubmission`

This function handles the submission of the contact form. It prevents the default form submission behavior, retrieves the name, email, and message from the form, and validates their lengths and format. If the inputs are valid, it displays a thank you message.

##### `validateEmail`

This function uses a regular expression to validate the format of an email address. It checks if the email string matches the pattern and returns a boolean indicating whether the email is valid.

##### `toggleNav`

This function toggles the navigation menu for mobile view. It selects the navigation links element and toggles the `active` class, which controls the visibility of the menu.

#### Event Listeners

Event listeners are added to handle various interactions on the page:

- The page load event initializes the quiz.
- Form submission events for the feedback and contact forms trigger their respective handling functions.
- Button click events for navigating to the next question, resetting the quiz, and restarting the quiz trigger their respective functions.
- The navigation icon click event triggers the `toggleNav` function to show or hide the navigation menu on mobile devices.
